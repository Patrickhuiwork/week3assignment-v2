## Reflection on creating this project

* when I was trying to implement the in class work that I completed into the page I created it took a very long time because their was alot of unnecessary code in my files

* I was unable to figure out why my objectFit=Cover and Function=responsive was not working 

* I utilized the plugins Tailwind Css IntelliSense and Es7 + ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets to setup my JSX files faster
